VaulTLS is a modern solution for managing mTLS (mutual TLS) certificates with ease.
It provides a centralized platform for generating, managing, and distributing client TLS certificates for your home lab.

The main reason why I developed VaulTLS was that I didn't like messing with shell scripts and OpenSSL.
I also did not have an overview about the expiration of individual certificates.

## Features

- üîí mTLS client and CA certificate management
- üì± Modern web interface for certificate management
- üîê OpenID Connect authentication support
- üì® Email notifications for certificate expiration
- üöÄ RESTful API for automation
- üõ† Docker/Podman container support
- ‚ö° Built with Rust (backend) and Vue.js (frontend) for performance and reliability

## Installation
Installation is managed through a Container. The app *needs* to be behind a reverse proxy for TLS handling.
`VAULTLS_API_SECRET` is required and should be a 256-bit base64 encoded string (`openssl rand -base64 32`).

```bash
podman run -d \
  --name vaultls \
  -p 5173:80 \
  -v vaultls-data:/app/data \
  -e VAULTLS_API_SECRET="[VAULTLS_API_SECRET]" \
  -e VAULTLS_URL="https://vaultls.example.com/" \
  ghcr.io/7ritn/vaultls:latest
```

### Setting up OIDC
To set up OIDC you need to create a new client in your authentication provider. For Authelia a configuration could look like this
```yaml
- client_id: "[client_id]"
  client_name: "vautls"
  client_secret: "[client_secret_hash]"
  public: false
  authorization_policy: "one_factor"
  pkce_challenge_method: "S256"
  redirect_uris:
    - "https://vaultls.example.com/api/auth/oidc/callback"
  scopes:
    - "openid"
    - "profile"
    - "email"
  userinfo_signed_response_alg: "none"
```
For VaulTLS the required variables can be configured via environmental variables or web UI.

| Environment Variable        | Value                                                |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `VAULTLS_OIDC_AUTH_URL`     | `https://auth.example.com`                           |
| `VAULTLS_OIDC_CALLBACK_URL` | `https://vaultls.example.com/api/auth/oidc/callback` |
| `VAULTLS_OIDC_ID`           | `[client_id]`                                        |
| `VAULTLS_OIDC_SECRET`       | `[client_secret]`                                    |

## Usage
During the first setup a Certificate Authority is automatically created. If OIDC is configured no password needs to be set.
Users can either log in via password or OIDC. If a user first logs in via OIDC their e-mail is matched with all VaulTLS users and linked.
If no user is found a new one is created.

Users can only see certificates created for them. Only admins can create new certificates.
User certificates can be downloaded through the web interface.

The CA certificate to be integrated with your reverse proxy is available as a file at /app/data/ca.cert 
and as download via the API endpoint /api/certificates/ca/download.

## Roadmap
- Add database encryption
- Hash passwords in Frontend
- Allow user details to be updated
- Generate new certificates automatically if the old one expires soon
- Add testing
