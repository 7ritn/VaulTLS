## üê≥ Installation

VaulTLS is deployed as a container and requires a reverse proxy for TLS termination. The `VAULTLS_API_SECRET` is required and should be a cryptographically secure 32+ character string.

### Basic Installation

```bash
podman run -d \
  --name vaultls \
  -p 5173:80 \
  -v vaultls-data:/app/data \
  -e VAULTLS_API_SECRET="your-secure-32-character-secret-key-here" \
  -e VAULTLS_URL="https://vaultls.example.com/" \
  ghcr.io/7ritn/vaultls:latest
```

### Production Installation with Security Controls

```bash
podman run -d \
  --name vaultls \
  -p 5173:80 \
  -v vaultls-data:/app/data \
  -v vaultls-config:/app/config \
  -e VAULTLS_API_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
  -e VAULTLS_URL="https://vaultls.company.com/" \
  -e VAULTLS_API_DOCS_ENABLED=false \
  -e VAULTLS_API_DOCS_REQUIRE_AUTH=true \
  -e VAULTLS_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS=2555 \
  -e VAULTLS_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=1000 \
  -e VAULTLS_LOG_LEVEL=info \
  ghcr.io/7ritn/vaultls:latest
```

### üîê Security Configuration

#### Database Encryption
Specify `VAULTLS_DB_SECRET` to encrypt the database. **Warning**: This is irreversible.

```bash
-e VAULTLS_DB_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

#### API Documentation Security
Control API documentation access for production environments:

```bash
# Disable API documentation entirely
-e VAULTLS_API_DOCS_ENABLED=false

# Require Bearer token authentication for API docs
-e VAULTLS_API_DOCS_REQUIRE_AUTH=true
```

#### Audit and Compliance
Configure audit retention and export limits:

```bash
-e VAULTLS_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS=2555        # 7 years retention
-e VAULTLS_AUDIT_EXPORT_MAX_RECORDS=100000  # Export limits
-e VAULTLS_CERTIFICATE_HISTORY_ENABLED=true # Full history tracking
```

### üìù Logging Configuration
Set log levels for different environments:

```bash
# Development
-e VAULTLS_LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Production
-e VAULTLS_LOG_LEVEL=info

# Troubleshooting (contains secrets - use carefully)
-e VAULTLS_LOG_LEVEL=trace
```

## üîë API Authentication

VaulTLS provides comprehensive API access through Bearer token authentication with granular scope-based permissions.

### Creating API Tokens

1. **Web Interface**: Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API Tokens
2. **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/tokens` with admin authentication

```bash
# Create an API token with certificate management scopes
curl -X POST https://vaultls.company.com/api/tokens \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer admin-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Certificate Management Token",
    "scopes": ["cert.read", "cert.write", "ca.read"],
    "expires_at": null,
    "rate_limit_per_minute": 1000
  }'
```

### Available Scopes

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `cert.read` | View certificates and search |
| `cert.write` | Create, update, and batch operations |
| `cert.revoke` | Revoke and restore certificates |

### API Documentation

- **Interactive Docs**: `https://your-domain/api-docs` (RapiDoc)
- **Reference Docs**: `https://your-domain/redoc` (Redoc)
- **OpenAPI Spec**: `https://your-domain/api/openapi.json`

### Example API Usage

```bash
# Search certificates
curl -X POST https://vaultls.company.com/api/certificates/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "filters": [
      {"field": "status", "operator": "eq", "value": "active"},
      {"field": "valid_until", "operator": "lt", "value": 1735689600}
    ],
    "sort": [{"field": "valid_until", "direction": "asc"}],
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 50
  }'

# Batch revoke certificates
curl -X POST https://vaultls.company.com/api/certificates/batch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "certificate_ids": [1, 2, 3],
    "operation": "revoke",
    "parameters": {
      "revocation_reason": 1,
      "revocation_note": "Security incident"
    }
  }'

# Get audit statistics
curl -X GET https://vaultls.company.com/api/audit/statistics?days=30 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
```

## üîê Setting up OIDC
To set up OIDC you need to create a new client in your authentication provider. For Authelia a configuration could look like this
```yaml
- client_id: "[client_id]"
  client_name: "vautls"
  client_secret: "[client_secret_hash]"
  public: false
  authorization_policy: "one_factor"
  pkce_challenge_method: "S256"
  redirect_uris:
    - "https://vaultls.example.com/api/auth/oidc/callback"
  scopes:
    - "openid"
    - "profile"
    - "email"
  userinfo_signed_response_alg: "none"
```
For VaulTLS the required variables can be configured via environmental variables or web UI.

| Environment Variable        | Value                                                |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `VAULTLS_OIDC_AUTH_URL`     | `https://auth.example.com`                           |
| `VAULTLS_OIDC_CALLBACK_URL` | `https://vaultls.example.com/api/auth/oidc/callback` |
| `VAULTLS_OIDC_ID`           | `[client_id]`                                        |
| `VAULTLS_OIDC_SECRET`       | `[client_secret]`                                    |

If VaulTLS claims that OIDC is not configured, the most likely cause is that it couldn't discover the OIDC provider based on the `VAULTLS_OIDC_AUTH_URL` given. In general the the base url to the auth provider should be enough. For Authentik the required URL path is `/application/o/<application slug>/`. If that doesn't work, directly specify the .well_known url. 

### Container Secrets
Certain environment variables can be Container Secrets instead of regular variables.
VaulTLS will try to read secrets from `/run/secrets/<ENV_NAME>`, if you want to specify a different path, you can do so in the environmental variable.
The following variables support secrets:
- VAULTLS_API_SECRET
- VAULTLS_DB_SECRET
- VAULTLS_OIDC_SECRET

## Usage
During the first setup a Certificate Authority is automatically created. If OIDC is configured no password needs to be set.
Users can either log in via password or OIDC. If a user first logs in via OIDC their e-mail is matched with all VaulTLS users and linked.
If no user is found a new one is created.

Users can only see certificates created for them. Only admins can create new certificates.
User certificates can be downloaded through the web interface.

The CA certificate to be integrated with your reverse proxy is available as a file at /app/data/ca.cert
and as download via the API endpoint /api/certificates/ca/download.

## API Documentation üöÄ

VaulTLS provides a comprehensive REST API for automation and integration:

- **üìñ Getting Started Guide**: [docs/api/getting-started.md](docs/api/getting-started.md)
- **üîç Interactive Documentation**: Visit `/api-docs` on your VaulTLS instance
- **üîê Authentication Guide**: [docs/api/authentication.md](docs/api/authentication.md)
- **üìã API Reference**: [docs/api/endpoints.md](docs/api/endpoints.md)
- **üìÑ OpenAPI Specification**: [docs/api/openapi.yaml](docs/api/openapi.yaml)

### Quick API Example

```bash
# Login and get session cookie
curl -X POST https://your-vaultls-instance.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@example.com", "password": "your-password"}' \
  -c cookies.txt

# List certificates
curl https://your-vaultls-instance.com/api/certificates -b cookies.txt

# Download CA certificate (no authentication required)
curl https://your-vaultls-instance.com/api/certificates/ca/download -o ca.pem
```

### Building Certificate Automation

The API is perfect for building ACME-like certificate automation services. See the [Getting Started Guide](docs/api/getting-started.md) for complete Python and Bash examples.

### PKCS12 Passwords
By default, PKCS12 passwords are optional and certificates will be generated with no password. In the settings page, the PKCS12 password requirements can be set with the following options:

| PKCS12 Password Rule  | Result                                              |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Optional              | Passwords are optional and can be blank             |
| Required              | Passwords are required, but can be system generated |
| System Generated      | Random passwords will be generated                  |

Passwords are stored in the database and retrieved from the web interface only when the user clicks on view password.

### Server Certificates
Since version v0.7.0 VaulTLS also has support for server certificates.
The user flow remains quite similar with the difference that SAN DNS entries can be specified.
Download is also using a possibly password-protected PKCS#12 file.
Since most reverse proxies require the certificate and private key to be supplied separately, the p12 may need to be split.
This can be done, for example, with openssl:
```sh
openssl pkcs12 -in INFILE.p12 -out OUTFILE.crt -nokeys
openssl pkcs12 -in INFILE.p12 -out OUTFILE.key -nodes -nocerts
```

### Caddy
To use caddy as reverse proxy for the VaulTLS app, a configuration like the following is required.
```caddyfile
reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:5173
```
To integrate the CA cert for client validation, you can either use a file or http based approach. Extend your TLS instruction for that with the client_auth section. Documentation here: [https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/tls#client_auth](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/tls#client_auth).

File based:
```caddyfile
tls {
  client_auth {
    mode <usually verify_if_given OR require_and_verify>
    trust_pool file {
      pem_file <Path to VaulTLS Directory>/ca.cert
    }
  }
}
```

HTTP based:
```caddyfile
tls {
  client_auth {
    mode <usually verify_if_given OR require_and_verify>
    trust_pool http {
      endpoints <Address of VaulTLS Instance such as 127.0.0.1:5173>/api/certificates/ca/download
    }
  }
}
```

If you choose `verify_if_given`, you can still block clients for apps that you want to require client authentication:
```caddyfile
@blocked {
  vars {tls_client_subject} ""
}
abort @blocked
```

## üìä Enterprise Features
